Project Overview:
Romeo is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to enhance user productivity through voice recognition, web automation, and real-time news retrieval. Developed using Python, Romeo responds to voice commands, performs web-based tasks, and fetches live news updates—all with a seamless conversational interface.

🔹 Key Features:
 Voice Recognition – Activated by the wake word "Romeo", enabling hands-free interaction.
 Text-to-Speech (TTS) – Provides spoken responses for an interactive experience.
 Web Automation – Opens Google, YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook, and other platforms instantly.
 News Fetching – Retrieves real-time headlines using the NewsAPI.
 Smart Command Processing – Executes a variety of predefined tasks based on voice input.

🔹 Tech Stack:
1. Python – Core programming language
2. SpeechRecognition – Enables voice command processing
3. pyttsx3 – Implements text-to-speech functionality
4. Webbrowser Module – Automates website navigation
5. Requests Library – Fetches real-time news data

💡 How It Works:
1️. Wake-Up Command – Romeo listens for its activation word and waits for instructions.
2️. Command Processing – Interprets voice input and executes relevant actions.
3️. Response Mechanism – Provides spoken and text-based feedback to users.

🔹 Future Enhancements:
 Integration with AI models for natural language processing (NLP)
 Adding task automation and smart reminders
 Expanding multi-language support

Impact:
Romeo is designed to be a personal AI companion, offering seamless automation and a voice-controlled experience, making technology more accessible and efficient.
