Project Overview:
 Romeo is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to enhance user productivity through voice recognition, web automation, and real-time news retrieval. Developed using 
 Python, Romeo responds to voice commands, performs web-based tasks, and fetches live news updates—all with a seamless conversational interface.

Key Features:
 1.Voice Recognition – Activated by the wake word "Romeo", enabling hands-free interaction.
 2.Text-to-Speech (TTS) – Provides spoken responses for an interactive experience.
 3.Web Automation – Opens Google, YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook, and other platforms instantly.
 4.News Fetching – Retrieves real-time headlines using the NewsAPI.
 5.Smart Command Processing – Executes a variety of predefined tasks based on voice input.

Tech Stack:
 1. Python – Core programming language
 2. SpeechRecognition – Enables voice command processing
 3. pyttsx3 – Implements text-to-speech functionality
 4. Webbrowser Module – Automates website navigation
 5. Requests Library – Fetches real-time news data

How It Works:
 1️. Wake-Up Command – Romeo listens for its activation word and waits for instructions.
 2️. Command Processing – Interprets voice input and executes relevant actions.
 3️. Response Mechanism – Provides spoken and text-based feedback to users.

Future Enhancements:
 1.Integration with AI models for natural language processing (NLP)
 2.Adding task automation and smart reminders
 3.Expanding multi-language support

Impact:
 Romeo is designed to be a personal AI companion, offering seamless automation and a voice-controlled experience, making technology more accessible and efficient.
