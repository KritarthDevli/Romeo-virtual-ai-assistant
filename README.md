🚀 Project Overview:
Romeo is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to enhance user productivity through voice recognition, web automation, and real-time news retrieval. Developed using Python, Romeo responds to voice commands, performs web-based tasks, and fetches live news updates—all with a seamless conversational interface.

🔹 Key Features:
✅ Voice Recognition – Activated by the wake word "Romeo", enabling hands-free interaction.
✅ Text-to-Speech (TTS) – Provides spoken responses for an interactive experience.
✅ Web Automation – Opens Google, YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook, and other platforms instantly.
✅ News Fetching – Retrieves real-time headlines using the NewsAPI.
✅ Smart Command Processing – Executes a variety of predefined tasks based on voice input.

🔹 Tech Stack:
🔹 Python – Core programming language
🔹 SpeechRecognition – Enables voice command processing
🔹 pyttsx3 – Implements text-to-speech functionality
🔹 Webbrowser Module – Automates website navigation
🔹 Requests Library – Fetches real-time news data

💡 How It Works:
1️⃣ Wake-Up Command – Romeo listens for its activation word and waits for instructions.
2️⃣ Command Processing – Interprets voice input and executes relevant actions.
3️⃣ Response Mechanism – Provides spoken and text-based feedback to users.

🔹 Future Enhancements:
🔜 Integration with AI models for natural language processing (NLP)
🔜 Adding task automation and smart reminders
🔜 Expanding multi-language support

🎯 Impact:
Romeo is designed to be a personal AI companion, offering seamless automation and a voice-controlled experience, making technology more accessible and efficient.
